# Dark Souls Icon Collection

This repository aims to provide a collection of most of the icons in Dark Souls in order to use them in your splits layout for speedrunning. Most icons are from http://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com. It's recommended to downscale the icons to about 30-40px since LiveSplits downscaling is suboptimal.
